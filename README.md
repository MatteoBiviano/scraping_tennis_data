# scraping_tennis_data
The "player_scraper.R" file contains the "scrapy" function which returns the data corresponding to Country, Height, Age, Year of Birth, Sex and Hand of Plays, of the player passed by argument. The same function, made in Julia, is included in the file "player_scraper.jl".
The comparison in performance between the two functions are made in Jupyter Notebook (in file scraping_comparison.ipynb)
